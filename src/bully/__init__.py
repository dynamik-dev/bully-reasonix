"""bully — agentic lint pipeline for Claude Code.

The package is organized as cohesive subpackages (config/, engines/, diff/,
semantic/, state/, runtime/, cli/, bench/). The names re-exported here are
the public surface used by tests and external callers; the underscore-
prefixed aliases preserve the historical names from the pre-restructure
single-file `pipeline.py`. Prefer the unprefixed names for new code.
