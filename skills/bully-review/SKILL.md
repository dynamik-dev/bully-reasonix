description: Reviews bully rule health from the telemetry log. Use when the user says "review my lint rules", "check rule health", "which lint rules are noisy", "find dead lint rules", "bully review", or asks for an audit of `.bully.yml`. Surfaces noisy, dead, and slow rules and suggests which to adjust, remove, or promote.

# Agentic Lint Review

Audit `.bully.yml` using the telemetry log at `.bully/log.jsonl`. See `docs/telemetry.md` for log schema and scope.

## Prerequisites

- `.bully.yml` and `.bully/log.jsonl` both exist.
- If the log is empty, stop and tell the user to make a handful of edits first -- classifying an empty log flags every rule as dead.

## Semantic rule observability

Both script and semantic rule verdicts are logged. Semantic rules emit two extra record types beyond the per-edit `rules:` array:

- `semantic_verdict` — pass/violation reported by the evaluator skill once it finishes (see `docs/telemetry.md`).
- `semantic_skipped` — pre-dispatch can't-match filters fired (whitespace only, comment only, etc.).

The analyzer counts `semantic_verdict` `violation` as a fire and `pass` as a pass. `semantic_skipped` keeps a rule out of the dead bucket while contributing zero to the violation rate. If a semantic rule appears dead, it genuinely was never considered in the window — recommend the same retirement path you would for a dead script rule.

## Step 1: Run the analyzer

```bash
python3 -m bully.semantic.analyzer --log .bully/log.jsonl --config .bully.yml
```

Add `--json` when you need structured output to reason over. Thresholds `--noisy-threshold` (default 0.5) and `--slow-threshold-ms` (default 500) are tunable. (If "No module named bully": `pip install -e <path-to-bully-reasonix>` first.)

## Step 1b: Hook health

The analyzer covers rules; these records cover the hook itself. Check them before
classifying -- a sick hook makes every rule look dead:

```bash
grep -c '"type": "hook_fail_open"' .bully/log.jsonl
```

Nonzero means the PreToolUse hook crashed and failed open -- those edits went
**unlinted**. Read the latest few (`grep '"type": "hook_fail_open"' .bully/log.jsonl | tail -3`),
report the `error` strings, and treat a repeating error as a bug to surface before any
rule tuning.

Also sanity-check the session stamps:

- `"type": "session_init"` -- one per Reasonix session. None in the whole log means the
  SessionStart hook isn't wired (`python3 -m bully doctor`) and the semantic verdict
  cache never resets per session.
- `"type": "subagent_stop"` -- evaluator/subagent completion markers. Zero despite
  `evaluate_requested` records means the SubagentStop hook isn't wired; harmless to
  rules, but telemetry undercounts evaluator activity.

## Step 2: Classify

The analyzer returns three buckets plus a `by_rule` table with `fires`, `passes`, `evaluate_requested`, `skipped`, `mean_latency_ms`, `files_touched`, and `violation_rate`.

- **noisy**: violation rate above threshold. Rule is too broad or the codebase is systemically at odds with it.
- **dead**: zero hits in the log window (both script and semantic).
- **slow**: mean latency above threshold. Usually external shell-outs (PHPStan, ESLint, Pint).

## Step 3: Recommend

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Noisy script rule | Tighten pattern, narrow scope glob, or demote severity to `warning`. |
| Noisy semantic rule | Sharpen the description (description IS the prompt) or split into two rules. |
| Dead script rule | Check scope glob first; if correct, remove the rule. |
| Slow rule | Cache, narrow scope, or move to pre-commit/CI. |
| Semantic rule with high `evaluate_requested` and no downstream edits | Candidate for promotion to a `script` rule. |
| Script rule grep-matching a structural pattern (likely noise from comments/strings) | FYI: propose conversion to `engine: ast`. Verify ast-grep is installed first. |
| Script rule catching a pattern an installed linter could express | FYI: propose moving the rule into the linter's config and replacing the bully rule with a passthrough (`script: "<linter> … {file}"`). Bully still enforces it via the hook. |

## Step 4: Present findings

Lead with a short prioritized punch list:

```
[rule-id] — <action> — <why>
```

Follow with brief noisy / dead / slow sections. Do not dump `by_rule` unless asked.

## Step 5: Hand off

Do not edit `.bully.yml` directly. When the user confirms a recommendation, hand off to the `bully-author` skill to apply it -- that skill tests rules against fixtures before writing.

## Background scheduling

For continuous self-pruning rather than ad-hoc cleanup, the `bully-scheduler` skill (`skills/bully-scheduler/SKILL.md`, `runAs: subagent`) runs the same analyzer and opens at most one rule-retirement PR per run. Invoke it as `/bully-scheduler` (or dispatch it via `run_skill`) for a one-off pruning pass, or run it on a schedule from CI/cron with a non-interactive `reasonix` invocation.
