# Agentic Lint Init

Generate a baseline `.bully.yml` by detecting the stack, wiring installed linters as passthroughs, and routing project-specific rules to the right enforcement mechanism.

## Framing: cop vs lawmakers

Bully is the cop; native linters (ruff, biome, eslint, tsc, phpstan, rubocop, golangci-lint, clippy, …) are the lawmakers. The PreToolUse hook runs on every pending edit (`edit_file`/`write_file`/`multi_edit`), so bully is always the entry point to enforcement. Where a rule *definition* lives is a separate question:

- **Linter passthrough** -- an installed linter owns the rule; `.bully.yml` has a passthrough (`engine: script`, `script: "<linter> <args> {file}"`) that invokes it on every edit.
- **ast / script / semantic** -- the rule lives directly in `.bully.yml`.

This skill is user-driven. Do not silently install tools or migrate rules. Every step below is a *proposal* the user accepts or declines.

## Step 1: Detect the stack

Read manifest files in the project root and map them to rule packs:

| Manifest | Pack candidates |
|---|---|
| `composer.json` | `php`, `laravel` (if `laravel/framework`), `symfony` (if `symfony/framework-bundle`) |
| `package.json` | `node`, `typescript` (if `tsconfig.json` or `devDependencies.typescript`), `react`, `vue`, `next`, `svelte` |
| `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` | `python`, `django`, `fastapi`, `flask` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `rust` |
| `go.mod` | `go` |
| `Gemfile` | `ruby`, `rails` (if `gem 'rails'`) |

Present what was detected and wait for confirmation before continuing.

## Step 2: Wire up installed linters as passthroughs

Detect which lint/format/typecheck tools the project already has on `PATH` or declared in its manifest: ruff, biome, eslint, prettier, tsc, phpstan, pint, rubocop, rubyfmt, golangci-lint, gofmt, clippy, ast-grep, pytest, etc.

For each one, ask:

> I found `<linter>` configured. Add a passthrough rule so bully runs it on every edit? The linter keeps owning its own rules -- bully just enforces "pass the linter" whenever you touch a matching file.

If yes, queue a rule like:

```yaml
  ruff-check:
    description: "Code must pass ruff check."
    engine: script
    scope: ["*.py"]
    severity: error
    script: "ruff check --quiet {file}"
```

Keep lint / format / typecheck as **separate** passthrough rules -- failure modes and messages are distinct, and `bully-review` telemetry stays legible per tool.

### Linter precedence when multiple overlap

If several installed tools cover overlapping concerns, pick the superset and skip the others (wiring all three causes conflicts). Default precedence:

| Stack | Prefer | Skip (superseded) |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Python | `ruff check` + `ruff format` | `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `pycodestyle`, `pydocstyle` |
| JS/TS | `biome` (if configured) OR `eslint` + `prettier` | do not wire both biome and eslint/prettier together |
| Ruby | `rubocop` | `standardrb` (choose one) |
| Go | `golangci-lint` | individual `staticcheck` / `revive` |

If the user *actively uses* a superseded tool (e.g. says "we still run isort in CI"), swap in their preferred tool instead. Call out what you're skipping and why before writing.

## Step 2b: Offer to install missing linters (optional, requires approval)

If the detected stack has no linter installed and one is conventional (ruff for Python, biome or eslint for JS/TS, golangci-lint for Go, rubocop for Ruby, phpstan for PHP, clippy for Rust), *offer* it as a choice -- do not push:

> You don't have a linter installed for `<stack>`. Most projects use `<tool>`. Want me to add it to `<manifest>` and wire up a passthrough? Or skip and we'll handle everything in bully directly.

Installing touches `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `composer.json` / CI, so this must be an explicit user opt-in. Never install silently. If the user declines, move on -- their `.bully.yml` can still cover everything via `ast`/`script`/`semantic` rules.

## Step 2c: Migrate project-specific rules (CLAUDE.md sections, arch tests, team conventions)

For each custom rule found (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` guidelines, Pest `arch()` tests, team docs, prose rules), route it using the same four-option decision tree as `bully-author`:

1. **Linter passthrough** -- can an installed linter (or one the user just opted into) enforce this with a rule-config edit? If yes, edit the linter's config AND queue a passthrough rule (if not already added in Step 2).
2. **ast** -- structural pattern, no linter covers it. Queue an `engine: ast` rule. Requires ast-grep installed.
3. **script (grep)** -- textual pattern with no false-positive risk on comments/strings.
4. **semantic** -- judgment only an LLM can make.

For each migration, state the enforcement-guarantee line once: *"Bully still runs on every edit -- we're just deciding where the rule definition lives."* Then present the chosen routing and wait for confirmation before queueing.

## Step 3: Ask setup questions

Before writing, ask:

- Default severity for new rules (`error` or `warning`)?
- Any additional globs to **skip** beyond the stack defaults? (See the defaults table below.) These become a top-level `skip:` list in `.bully.yml` -- the key is `skip`, not `exclude` or `ignore`.

**Telemetry is mandatory plumbing, not a setup choice -- do not ask about it.** bully provisions `.bully/` automatically on its first run and the directory ignores itself via its own `.bully/.gitignore` (`*`). There is nothing to enable, no opt-out, and no telemetry key inside `.bully.yml`.

### Stack-aware default skip globs

Seed `skip:` with the defaults for the detected stack(s). Merge across stacks if multiple apply (e.g. a repo with `package.json` and `pyproject.toml`).

| Stack | Default skip globs |
|-------|-------------------|
| Python | `.venv/**`, `venv/**`, `**/__pycache__/**`, `.pytest_cache/**`, `.ruff_cache/**`, `.mypy_cache/**`, `build/**`, `dist/**`, `*.egg-info/**` |
| Node/JS/TS | `node_modules/**`, `dist/**`, `build/**`, `.next/**`, `.nuxt/**`, `.output/**`, `coverage/**`, `*.min.js` |
| PHP | `vendor/**`, `storage/**`, `bootstrap/cache/**`, `public/build/**` |
| Go | `vendor/**`, `bin/**` |
| Rust | `target/**` |
| Ruby | `vendor/**`, `tmp/**`, `log/**`, `public/assets/**` |
| Universal | `.git/**`, `.idea/**`, `.vscode/**` (only add if present) |

Present the merged list and ask the user to add/remove before writing.

## Step 4: Seed rules from the examples catalog

Bully ships an `examples/rules/` directory -- a catalog of common rules organized by tech (react-ts, nextjs, django, fastapi, go, rails, rust-cli). **These are examples, not a blessed baseline.** Do not auto-`extends:` them. Instead, for the detected stack, open the matching `examples/rules/<stack>.yml`, show the user the rule list with one-line summaries, and ask which ones to seed. Copy the selected rules inline into the generated `.bully.yml` -- the user owns them from then on.

If the user declines all of them, write an empty `rules:` block and let the `bully-author` skill add rules as they come up.

## Step 5: Write `.bully.yml`

Write to the project root. The parser expects 2-space indentation for rule IDs under `rules:` and 4-space indentation for each rule's fields. Scope is an inline list.

### Allowed top-level keys (exhaustive)

**Only these keys are valid at the top level of `.bully.yml`:**

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `schema_version` | Optional integer, reserved for future migrations. |
| `extends` | List of shared rule-pack paths. |
| `rules` | Map of rule-id → rule definition. |
| `skip` | List of globs excluded from all rules. **The key is `skip` -- not `exclude`, `ignore`, `excludes`, or `ignores`.** |
| `execution` | Map with `max_workers` (int). |

**Do not invent other top-level keys.** In particular, there is no `telemetry:` key -- telemetry is mandatory plumbing that the runtime provisions automatically; it is never configured.

### Rule shape

```yaml
schema_version: 1
skip:
  - "vendor/**"
  - "node_modules/**"
rules:
  rule-id:
    description: "What the rule enforces"
    engine: script        # script | ast | semantic
    scope: ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
    severity: error       # error | warning
    script: "command {file}"   # script engine only
```

For multi-line descriptions use a folded scalar (`description: >`). Quote all script values with double quotes. Use `{file}` as the target file placeholder. Formatters use `severity: warning`; correctness rules use `severity: error`.

### Draft-then-validate protocol (MANDATORY)

Never write directly to `.bully.yml` on init. Draft first, parse-check the draft, and only rename on pass. This prevents polluting the user's project with an invalid config if the LLM hallucinates a key (e.g. the historical `telemetry:` / `exclude:` mistakes).

```bash
# 1. Write the draft to a scratch path (use the file-write tool):
#      /tmp/bully-init-draft.yml  <-- full proposed .bully.yml contents
#
# 2. Parse-check the draft ($BULLY deliberately unquoted -- the fallback is multi-word):
BULLY=$(command -v bully 2>/dev/null || echo "python3 -m bully")
$BULLY --validate --config /tmp/bully-init-draft.yml
```

Exit code `0` + no `[FAIL]` output = draft is valid. Nonzero exit = draft is broken: read the `[FAIL]` line (e.g. `unknown top-level key 'telemetry'`), fix the draft in place, re-check. **Do not overwrite `.bully.yml` until `--validate` exits clean.**

Once the draft validates:

```bash
mv /tmp/bully-init-draft.yml .bully.yml
```

### Binary resolution

A pip install of `bully-reasonix` (e.g. `pip install -e <repo>`) provides both the `bully` console script and the `bully` module. Resolve once and use `$BULLY` -- unquoted, the fallback is a multi-word command -- in every command below:

```bash
BULLY=$(command -v bully 2>/dev/null || echo "python3 -m bully")
```

If `$BULLY --validate ...` fails with "No module named bully", bully-reasonix isn't installed in this Python environment: run `pip install -e <path-to-bully-reasonix>` first.

## Step 6: Verify and enable

Before handing off, bring the config into a runnable state:

1. **Trust the config** so script/ast rules can execute: `$BULLY trust` (equivalently `$BULLY --trust --config .bully.yml`).
2. **Run `$BULLY doctor`** and surface any `[FAIL]` lines. Doctor checks the Reasonix wiring; the two failures you can fix from here:
   - `[FAIL] no PreToolUse hook ...` -- the project's `.reasonix/settings.json` does not invoke the bully hook, so edits are not linted. Offer to write this hooks block (merge into an existing file rather than overwriting):

     ```json
     {
       "hooks": {
         "PreToolUse": [{ "match": "edit_file|write_file|multi_edit", "command": "python3 -m bully reasonix-hook", "timeout": 15000 }],
         "Stop": [{ "command": "python3 -m bully reasonix-hook", "timeout": 15000 }],
         "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "command": "python3 -m bully reasonix-hook", "timeout": 10000 }],
         "SessionStart": [{ "command": "python3 -m bully reasonix-hook" }],
         "SubagentStop": [{ "command": "python3 -m bully reasonix-hook" }]
       }
     }
     ```

   - `[FAIL] skill bully-evaluator missing ...` -- the bully skills aren't discoverable. Offer to add to the project's `reasonix.toml`:

     ```toml
     [skills]
     paths = ["<path-to-bully-reasonix>/skills"]
     ```

   `[WARN]` lines are advisory (optional event wirings, missing companion skills); report them, don't chase them. Any other `[FAIL]` is real -- surface it.
3. **Telemetry is automatic -- no action needed.** bully provisions `.bully/` (self-ignoring via its own `.bully/.gitignore`) on its first run, so `bully-review` has a log to read. Do not `mkdir` it and do not touch the repo's root `.gitignore`.
4. **Smoke-test script rules.** For each rule with a concrete `script:`, pick the first in-scope file (e.g. `git ls-files | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx)$' | head -1` against the rule's scope) and run `$BULLY lint <file> --rule <rule-id>`. Report each verdict. If a rule that is *meant* to fire on a known pattern returns pass, flag it as a likely miscompile -- surface it now, not after 40 edits.

## Step 7: Summarize and hand off

After the verification pass, print:

```
.bully.yml generated.

Stack: <detected>
Extends: <packs>
Migrated: <count> rules from <sources>
Overrides: <count>
Excluded globs: <list>
Trust: <granted|failed>
Doctor: <pass|N failures>
Smoke test: <N passed, N flagged>
```

Tell the user: "To add project-specific rules, use `/bully-author`. To audit rule health later, use `/bully-review`."

## Troubleshooting

- **No manifests found**: Ask the user for the stack and extend the matching pack.
- **Existing `.bully.yml`**: Offer overwrite, merge (append new rules only), or abort.
- **Binary referenced by a shell-out rule missing**: Write the rule anyway and note the install command in the summary.
